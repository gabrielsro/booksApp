The app's initial purpose is to arrange and organize a library of books. The following functions are included:

1. Add a book and specify its title, author, publishing year, number of pages, whether or not it's been read
   by the user and a cover via image URL.
2. Remove a book from the library.
3. Once created, toggle its original status from read to unread and vice-versa.
